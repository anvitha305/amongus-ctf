# Writeup for Web Challenge/Among Us

Authors: [Anvitha Ramachandran](https://github.com/anvitha305)

## Description

An Among Us themed set of tasks to break into the Main Hall control panel! 

## Challenge
This challenge will teach you about WordPress exploits and use the tools from CS 561.

## Ways of solving it
You can either use Metasploitable or Hydra to crack the passwords for the database or the wp-admin credentials, respectfully. The files on the page are the usernames and passwords for cracking but you wouldn't necessarily need those for the SQLi attack for Metasploit, using Nmap to find out the versioning and finding the Metasploit exploit for the versioning works fine
